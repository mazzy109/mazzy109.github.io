Part of what makes this a little tricky is that you have to remember the formatting exactly. That being said, no amount of formatting speed bumps can stop me from shouting my spirit song out into the internet: Xenoblade Chronicles Remake is okay!! I'm having a good time with it and I'm excited to see the world open up, its just that its a rather expensive game and I am not a fan of that buyer's remorse. Which is a tricky feeling because it's not as if I'm going to resell it or return it before I finish it, so that shouldn't have any impact on how I feel as I'm playing it. Weird feeling.
