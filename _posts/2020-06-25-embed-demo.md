Basically from what I can tell, you just have to have the include ready to go in your includes folder, and then paste your link with the correct imbed id. So like this I think:

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="Q2aaCDNjWEg" %}

Lets test that.

Okay, So I had to change the include plugin, but now you just need the youtube ID in the id=X part of that include.
